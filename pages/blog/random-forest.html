                <h1>Random Forest</h1>
                <p>
                    <strong>Random Forest</strong> is an ensemble learning method used for classification, regression, and other tasks, which operates by constructing a multitude of decision trees during training. The output of the random forest is either the mode of the classifications or the mean prediction of the individual trees.
                </p>
                <h2>How Random Forest Works</h2>
                <p>
                    Random Forest works by creating multiple decision trees, each trained on a random subset of the data. These individual trees each make a prediction, and the final output is decided by averaging (for regression) or majority voting (for classification).
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Randomly select subsets from the dataset (with replacement).</li>
                    <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Construct a decision tree for each subset.</li>
                    <li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Make predictions with each tree.</li>
                    <li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Combine predictions from all trees to make a final prediction.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Advantages of Random Forest</h2>
                <p>
                    Random Forest is known for its high accuracy and ability to handle large datasets with higher dimensionality. It is also less prone to overfitting compared to individual decision trees.
                </p>
                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>
                    Random Forest is a powerful and versatile machine learning model that performs well in both classification and regression tasks. Its ensemble nature makes it robust against overfitting and capable of handling complex datasets.
